      <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>
        were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br>

          " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the Bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
          I signed up for <br>
          the free inro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 <br>
          weeks were the best and most grueling time of my life.
          since completing the course, I've<br>
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR start-up."

      <h2>the team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2>
      <p>" I started as a total newbie with <br>
        virtually no coding skills.
        I now work <br>
        as a mobile engineer for a big <br>
        company.
        it was one of the best<br>
        investments I've made in myself."</p>

      <h2>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h2>
      <p>" before joining the Bootcamp, I've <br> never written a line of code.
        I needed<br>some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step.
        I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program.
        the entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint.
        they were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance.
        the agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. it took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>
        that no tutorial could ever have
        in <br>
        fact, I have often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> development experience.
        it certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommended."

      <h2>awesome teaching support from TAs who did the Bootcamp<br> themselves. getting guidance from them and learning from<br> their experiences was easy</h2>
      <p>"the staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.<br> the program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
